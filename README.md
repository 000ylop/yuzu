citra emulator
==============
[![Travis CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/citra-emu/citra.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/citra-emu/citra)

An experimental open-source Nintendo 3DS emulator/debugger written in C++. Citra is written with portability in mind, with builds actively maintained for Windows, Linux and OS X. At this time, it only emulates a subset of 3DS hardware, and therefore is generally only useful for booting/debugging very simple homebrew demos. Citra is licensed under the GPLv2. Refer to the license.txt file included. Please read the [FAQ](https://github.com/citra-emu/citra/wiki/FAQ) before getting started with the project.
