citra emulator
==============
An open-source Nintendo 3DS emulator/debugger written in C++. At this time, it only emulates a very small subset of 3DS hardware, and therefore is only useful for booting/debugging very simple homebrew demos. 

For development discussion, please join us @ #citra on [freenode](http://webchat.freenode.net/).
